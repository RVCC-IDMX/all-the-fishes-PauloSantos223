# Coding Strategy
# First, I used the background image of an aquarium to fit the screen.
# I loaded in every assets that I would need in the project and
# tried to position everything neatly. I added animations to the fish, 
# the coral, and the bubbles to add some life to the aquarium. 
# I had a bit of trouble getting the bubbles to properly be setup, but
# I managed to get it to work. I also had a hard time with Mr. Starfish
# going off the aquarium nonstop. I tried my best to manage him in the 
# aquarium with as many constraints as I could possibly find.
